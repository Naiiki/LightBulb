        <h2>Concept</h2>
        <p>
          The LightBulb app is designed to be a minimalist and efficient space
          for organizing, sharing, and developing ideas. Inspired by the way a
          lightbulb flickers to life when a new thought emerges, the app
          provides a simple, intuitive platform where users can quickly capture
          their thoughts and ideas, collaborate with others, and refine them
          into tangible projects.
